### 超级详细描述
Describe Music is an AI-powered audio analysis platform that instantly decodes the core elements of any music track. By simply uploading an audio file, users receive detailed insights into genre classification (e.g., synth-pop, jazz fusion), emotional mood profiles (e.g., "energetic 85%, nostalgic 70%"), technical parameters (BPM ±2, musical key), and instrumentation breakdown (e.g., lead synth, electric bass). The entire process takes just 10–15 seconds, requires no registration, and supports formats like MP3, WAV, FLAC, and AAC.

Built on deep learning models trained on millions of tracks, Describe Music prioritizes accessibility and privacy. It’s 100% free with no feature restrictions, automatically deletes uploaded files after analysis (GDPR-compliant), and runs directly in any modern browser. While ideal for musicians tagging demos, podcasters matching mood-based background music, or educators teaching music theory, it currently supports single-file analysis only and lacks API/DAW integration. Experience professional-grade audio insights at describemusic.net—no cost, no complexity.

Key Highlights Embedded:
1. Core Functionality: Genre, mood, BPM, key, and instrumentation analysis
2. User Workflow: Upload → AI analysis → Instant report (10–15 sec)
3. Differentiators:
    ◦ Privacy-first (auto-file deletion)
    ◦ Zero technical skills required
4. Limitations: Single-file only, no API (transparently stated)
5. Call-to-Action: Direct link for immediate testing
### 一句话描述
- An AI platform that decodes music’s core elements—genre, mood, BPM, key, and instrumentation—in seconds.

### 动机
As a musician, I grew tired of manually tagging song genres and BPM. Existing tools were either expensive or required copyright clearance. So we built Describe Music: a free, no-strings-attached AI tool. Upload any track, get genre/mood/BPM analysis in 30 seconds — no file storage, no fees, no signups. We believe tech should serve one purpose: help creators save time for what matters: making music.
